# Enhanced Top Stories Algorithm

## üéØ Overview

The Enhanced Top Stories Algorithm transforms the simple time-based ranking into a sophisticated multi-factor scoring system that considers engagement, source credibility, content quality, social signals, and category diversity.

## üìä Algorithm Components

### 1. **Engagement-Based Scoring (25% weight)**
- **View Count**: Tracks article visibility using Intersection Observer
- **Click Count**: Records when users click to read full articles  
- **Share Count**: Tracks social sharing actions
- **Read Time**: Measures actual time spent reading content
- **Bounce Rate**: Calculates user retention on articles

**Implementation**: 
- Frontend tracking with `useEngagementTracking` hook
- Real-time API endpoints for engagement data
- Logarithmic scaling to handle wide ranges

### 2. **Source Credibility Weighting (30% weight)**
- **Credibility Score**: Overall trustworthiness (0.0-1.0)
- **Reliability Score**: Consistency and accuracy (0.0-1.0)
- **Bias Score**: Political/editorial bias (-1.0 to 1.0)
- **Factual Score**: Fact-checking accuracy (0.0-1.0)

**Default Scores**:
```yaml
BBC News: 0.9 credibility, 0.95 reliability
Reuters: 0.9 credibility, 0.95 reliability  
CNN: 0.75 credibility, 0.8 reliability
NDTV Sports: 0.75 credibility, 0.8 reliability
```

### 3. **Content Analysis via NLP (20% weight)**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone of content
- **Importance Scoring**: Keyword-based significance detection
- **Readability Analysis**: Flesch Reading Ease calculation
- **Entity Extraction**: People, organizations, dates, money
- **Topic Classification**: Automatic categorization

**Features**:
- Breaking news keyword detection
- Statistical content analysis (numbers, quotes)
- Language detection and normalization

### 4. **Social Media Signals (15% weight)**
- **Twitter Shares**: Social media engagement (simulated)
- **Facebook Shares**: Platform-specific metrics
- **Reddit Score**: Community-driven engagement
- **LinkedIn Shares**: Professional network activity
- **Sentiment Data**: Social media sentiment analysis

**Implementation**: 
- API integrations with fallback to simulation
- 6-hour refresh intervals for social metrics
- Logarithmic scaling for viral content

### 5. **Recency Factor (10% weight)**
- **Exponential Decay**: Newer articles get higher scores
- **Maximum Age**: 24-hour window for top stories consideration
- **Decay Rate**: Configurable freshness importance

## üéõÔ∏è Category Balancing

Ensures diverse content representation:

- **Minimum Categories**: At least 3 different categories
- **Maximum per Category**: No more than 2 articles per category
- **Required Categories**: Technology, Business, World News
- **Category Weights**: Technology (1.1x), Sports (0.9x), Entertainment (0.8x)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables:
1. **article_scores**: Comprehensive scoring data
2. **engagement_metrics**: User interaction tracking
3. **source_credibility**: Source reliability ratings
4. **content_analysis**: NLP analysis results
5. **social_metrics**: Social media engagement data

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Enhanced Endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/news/top-stories` - Enhanced algorithm results
- `POST /api/v1/news/{id}/track/view` - Track article views
- `POST /api/v1/news/{id}/track/click` - Track article clicks
- `POST /api/v1/news/{id}/track/share` - Track article shares
- `POST /api/v1/news/{id}/track/read-time` - Track reading time
- `GET /api/v1/news/{id}/score` - Get article score breakdown
- `GET /api/v1/news/analytics/engagement` - Engagement analytics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```yaml
top_stories:
  scoring_weights:
    engagement_weight: 0.25    # User engagement
    credibility_weight: 0.30   # Source credibility  
    content_weight: 0.20       # NLP analysis
    social_weight: 0.15        # Social media
    recency_weight: 0.10       # Article freshness
  
  category_balance:
    min_categories: 3
    max_per_category: 2
    required_categories: ["technology", "business", "world"]
  
  min_score: 0.3              # Quality threshold
  max_age: "24h"              # Freshness window
  refresh_interval: "15m"     # Recalculation frequency
```

## üîÑ Algorithm Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch articles from last 24 hours
2. **Engagement Analysis**: Calculate user interaction scores
3. **Credibility Assessment**: Apply source reliability weights
4. **Content Processing**: Run NLP analysis for importance
5. **Social Metrics**: Gather social media engagement data
6. **Recency Calculation**: Apply time-based decay
7. **Score Aggregation**: Weighted combination of all factors
8. **Category Balancing**: Ensure diverse topic representation
9. **Final Ranking**: Sort by composite score
10. **Result Delivery**: Return top N articles

## üìà Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = (
  Engagement √ó 0.25 +
  Credibility √ó 0.30 +
  Content √ó 0.20 +
  Social √ó 0.15 +
  Recency √ó 0.10
) √ó Category_Weight
```
